# halite3_michaelwan_bot
My (Michael Wan) attempt on halite 3 competition. It is developed in 1.5 weeks only and the highest rank is 18 (during first a few weeks), then abondoned and dropped to #183 finally. Although it didn't win, it only have ~600 lines of codes, which consist of main components like destination selection, collision/move strategies, dropoff/spawn strategies, etc.
